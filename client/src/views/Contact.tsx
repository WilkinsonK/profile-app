                    Before making an attempt to contact me directly, you may
                    want to review some of the below <b>common Q's</b>. These
                    listed are generally the most often asked or most likely
                    reason others in the past have reached out.

                    The majority of what you'll read here is only going to be
                    a top-level view of what I might still be able to elaborate
                    further on. However, there is a high likelihood that these
                    topics have also been covered by other material on my
                    website.
